# SafeMaps
Your Safe way home
https://safemaps.co/

On usual maps we can see the traffic and types of places. But as a traveller, especially if in a foreign city more important than traffic is to know which streets and areas to avoid. If you are woman, alone at night in the city, you would certainly wish you knew the safest route to your destination. Our application exists to serve that purpose. We have demonstrated the crime density of the frequency of crimes committed in San Francisco. The density was computed by the data found from San Francisco crime dataset from Kaggle.


Our work:
Data Visualization using HTML and Python
Sorted data according to the crimes listed in the data set and grouped them by cumulative frequency 
Usage of Google API services
Geospatial Visualization using GeoJSON Data
Deploying and hosting the prototype on Firebase
